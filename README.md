# Countdown Timer App

Welcome to the Countdown Timer App! This React-based application allows users to start a countdown timer and receive scores based on how close they stop the timer to the end. The app leverages React's hooks and features, providing a smooth and interactive user experience.

## Features

- **Countdown Timer:** Start a countdown from a specified time and watch it tick down to zero.
- **Scoring System:** Users receive scores based on how close they stop the timer to the designated end time.
- **React Hooks:** Utilizes `useState`, `useRef`, and imperative handling for managing state and references.
- **Ref Forwarding:** Allows components to access DOM nodes directly.
- **Portals:** Renders components outside their parent hierarchy for better UI management.
- **Vite:** Built using Vite for a faster and more customizable development experience compared to Create React App.
