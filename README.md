# Countdown Timer App

Welcome to the Countdown Timer App! This React-based application features pre-set countdown timers that allow users to test their timing skills. The goal is to stop the timer as close to the end as possible, earning scores based on your precision. You can also customize your name to track your scores!

## Features

- **Pre-set Countdown Timers:** Multiple countdown timers are available, and users cannot change their durations.
- **Scoring System:** Earn scores based on how close you stop the timer to zero.
- **Name Customization:** Change your name to personalize your experience and keep track of your scores.
- **React Hooks:** Utilizes `useState`, `useRef`, and imperative handling for state management and DOM access.
- **Ref Forwarding:** Allows components to access and interact with DOM nodes directly.
- **Portals:** Renders components outside their parent hierarchy for improved UI management.
- **Vite:** Built using Vite for a faster, more customizable development experience compared to Create React App.
